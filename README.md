# My-Day-Scheduler

The task on this challenge was to create a Day Schedule that would display past, present and future reminders.
As part of the challenge, the user should be able to input the information on each time slot and even when the page is
refreshed all reminders are still saved. 

## Description

When page loads the user will be able to see the current date and title displayed on the header.
As user scrolls down the the page, a schedule will be displayed with business hours slots where reminders should be added and saved.
As user refreshes the page all the data previously added will still be showing.
As the time passes each event saved will show three different colors for each condition of the event: 
past = gray, present = red and future = green.
