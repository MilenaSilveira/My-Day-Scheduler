# My-Day-Scheduler

The task on this challenge was to create a Day Schedule that would display past, present and future reminders.
As part of the challenge, the user should be able to input the information on each time stol and even when the page is
refreshed all reminders are still saved. 

## Description

When user opens the page, will be able to see the current dat displayed on the header.
As user scrolls down will be able to see time slots for business hours, where reminders should be added and saved.
As user refreshes the page all the data previously added will still be saved.
As the time passes each event saved will show three different colors for each condition of the event: 
past = gray, present = red and future = green.
